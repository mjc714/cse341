	- some tuples were done manually by me, ie small edits for specific entries/syntax

After executing the jar:
	- enter oracle id and pw
	- One may want to be a manager first to get an idea of the state of the DB,
	- then from there be a customer to make modfications to it
	- then switch back to the manager to view these changes etc.
	- then pick an option to explore: 1. Customer	2. Manager -1.Exit
	- Customer - 1. Make Online Purchase	-1. Exit
		-	1. displays the online purchase inventory
				- then proceeds to guide user through entering item_ids and quantities they want to buy
				- after input is done, the DB is updated to reflect changes, which should be able to be seen by the Manager
	Manager - 1. Print Store Inventory	2. Check restock needs	3. Generate Physical and Online Sales Report	-1. Exit
		- 1. prompts user to pick a location, then prints out all physical inventory at that store
		- 2. checks DB for low stock and then automatically restocks these
		- 3. creates physical and online sales reports reporting various info such as most sold item(s) per store type, total revenue for respective stores
			- and total revenue for both, 
		- it is best to go through options in order of 1->2->1->3->4 to see all changes and updates and then proceed to view the reports
		- in particular, for option 4 to work, be sure to run option 3 first part of the calculation is handled there
